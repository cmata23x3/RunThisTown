Run This Town
=======

Picture this, you are a new freshman at MIT and coming from the South, you're in a new place with new sites to see. Conscious of the notorious "Freshman 15", you also want to stay active and healthy. Run This Town (RTT) is a website that allows the user to do both at the same time. RTT allows users to plan paths using Google Maps and choose where they'd like to visit. It also allows users to save paths that they enjoy and make connections with other users. 

Using Ruby on Rails, Daniel developed the frontend, Christian developed the backend and Calvin contributed to both areas.
